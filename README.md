# PythonProjects

This project posts comment to reddit posts on reddit.com/r/frgualmalefashion subreddit when the post contains certain words 
eg"boots, redwing, wolverine"


It logs the post id in a text file so when the script is ran the next time, no comment is made on a previously commented post.
